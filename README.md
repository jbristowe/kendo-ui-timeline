# kendo-ui-timeline

This timeline provides a history of Kendo UI since its inception back in August 2011. It's built using Kendo UI.

Building a timeline component for separate and independent frameworks provided a good perspective on the different approaches one must take when targeting Kendo UI and jQuery and Kendo UI for Angular. I was curious to see how much code and markup could be shared between the two frameworks. As it turns out, much of the frontend implementation remained the same. A main difference I observed was how the components themselves were structured. The approach used for the implementation targeting Kendo UI for Angular lent itself better for testing. However, both solutions produced the same result.
